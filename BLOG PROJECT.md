#BLOG

We would like to build a blog tool where authors can post text and pictures. An author should be able to create new posts and edit existing posts. An author should also be able to change the title of the blog and set a header piture for the blog. A blog can have several authors. Each author has a login in order to be able to create or edit posts. Followers should be able to comment on individual posts. An author should be able to administrate comments. An admin has the ability to create new authors to a specific blog.

Once you enter the blog you reach the main page which consists of the latest posts. You can reach the other pages on the blog such as, about, categories and login via a menu list.

Once an author has successfully logged in an additional menu list will displayed where you can reach pages to create a new post or edit blog info. An edit button will also appear below each post.
